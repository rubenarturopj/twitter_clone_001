## Like and follow functionality

1. Go to `pages/api/` folder and create a new file `follow.ts`. Type the necessary functions to handle when start following someone and then stop following that user.

2. Now we need a hook for this. So, go to `hooks` folder and create a new file called `useFollow.ts`. Write the file and make sure to export it at the bottom.

3. Go to `components/user/UserBio.tsx`.
